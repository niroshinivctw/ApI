package com.example.containeroptimizer.model;

import java.util.List;

public class PickSpotRequest {
    private List<List<Integer>> yardMap;

    public List<List<Integer>> getYardMap() {
        return yardMap;
    }

    public void setYardMap(List<List<Integer>> yardMap) {
        this.yardMap = yardMap;

}

JSON Request to Test:

If you want to test the API, you can send the following JSON request to POST /pickSpot:

{
  "yardMap": [
    [5, 8, 9],
    [4, 3, 6],
    [7, 2, 1]
  ]
}

Expected Response:

If the service logic is working, it should return the optimal spot (in this case, the lowest score):

{
  "row": 2,
  "column": 2,
  "score": 1
}
